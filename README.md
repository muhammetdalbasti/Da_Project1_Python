<h1 align='center'>RHODE ISLAND EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS</h1>

## Business Case

By using Exploratory Data Analysis, on Rhode Island's Police Department and Weather data on that period of time, I try to find which type of violations committed. Do Gender has effect
on Police's decision. Is there any significant effect of weather conditions on crime and police's decisions.
